## What Was Asked

Produce a structured requirements document for Movie League v1.1 — a delta release over an existing application — covering 2 confirmed bugs (logged movies in watchlist, datetime-local instead of date), 1 new feature (featured movies empty state on home page), and 19 UX improvements identified through a UX audit. Constraints: no schema changes, no new npm packages.

## What Worked

- Produced a complete document on first pass with zero revision needed
- Correctly captured the v1.1 delta framing — explicitly stated "all v1 requirements remain in force" and scoped the document to changes only
- 2 bugs and 19 UX items each received precise acceptance criteria that were binary and testable (e.g., "submitting with date 2024-03-15 results in watched_at 2024-03-15T00:00:00.000Z")
- FEAT-01 requirements distinguished correctly between: empty feed (zero items from feed query) vs. zero social connections — and surfaced this as an open question rather than making a silent assumption
- Correctly scoped FEAT-01 persistence: "movies are persisted only when a user acts on them" — anticipating the architect's decision
- Priority tiers (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) on UX items gave the architect and planner useful ordering signals
- Out-of-scope section was precise and matched what the user had confirmed off-limits (Discord bot, group visibility changes)
- Open questions section identified 3 genuine ambiguities (admin self-removal flow, modal vs. page for Log a Movie, empty-state threshold) that the architect resolved

## What Didn't Work

- Nothing significant. Document accepted by architect and orchestrator without revision.

## Recommendations for Agent Improvement

- When writing requirements for delta releases (v1.1, v2.0, etc.), consider adding a "Changed from v1" column to acceptance criteria tables to make regressions easier to detect
- For UX audit inputs, explicitly flag which items came from the audit vs. direct user report — this helps prioritize during implementation (reported bugs should always be HIGH)
