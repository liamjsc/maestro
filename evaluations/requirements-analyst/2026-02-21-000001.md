## What Was Asked
Produce a structured, unambiguous requirements document for Movie League — a social movie tracking web app with Discord OAuth, groups, watchlists, activity feeds, a 5-star rating system (0–5 in 0.5 increments), and a Discord bot that posts per-group notifications to configured channels.

## What Worked
- Produced 45 functional requirements and 11 non-functional requirements on the first pass with zero need for revision
- Correctly captured all nuanced requirements including the 0.5-increment rating constraint, group invite URL + optional password mechanism, and the feed extensibility NFR (future comments/reactions must not require a structural migration)
- Identified and surfaced 7 genuine open questions rather than making silent assumptions — this gave the architect exactly the right decision points
- Distinguished between "log a movie" and "mark as watched" as two distinct operations with different data requirements
- Clearly scoped out-of-scope items, preventing future scope creep
- Non-functional requirements were specific and measurable (sub-2s page load, sub-1.5s search, WCAG 2.1 AA, 320px minimum viewport)

## What Didn't Work
- Nothing significant failed. The document was accepted by the orchestrator and architect without any revision cycle.

## Recommendations for Agent Improvement
- Consider prompting for explicit confirmation on the "rating required vs optional" question upfront rather than surfacing it as an open question — it is almost always a product decision that blocks implementation
- Could proactively flag Discord snowflake ID precision issues (they exceed JS number precision) as a technical risk in a "Technical Risks" section
