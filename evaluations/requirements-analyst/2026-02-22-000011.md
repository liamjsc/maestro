## What Was Asked

Produce a requirements document (`specs/requirements-v1.2.md`) for two FeaturedMoviesGrid gaps reported by the user: (1) the "Mark as Watched" button not updating after logging a movie, and (2) the absence of a persistent "Not Interested" / hide mechanism for featured movies.

## What Worked

- Correctly scoped this as a delta release — identified it as a bug fix (BUG-03) plus a new feature (FEAT-02) against the existing v1 and v1.1 baseline.
- BUG-03 requirements were precise: button label changes to "Logged ✓", disabled state, client-side update only, plus server-side `isLogged` flag for initial page load.
- FEAT-02 requirements covered the complete surface: UI button, optimistic removal, persistence via `(user_id, tmdb_id)` unique table, server-side exclusion on next load, idempotent API endpoint, and edge cases (failure rollback, exhausted grid).
- Data model specified correctly: `not_interested` table with `tmdb_id` as a bare integer (no FK to movies), unique constraint on `(user_id, tmdb_id)`, user-scoped index.
- API contract specified: `POST /api/not-interested`, 201/200/400/401 status codes, idempotency on duplicate.
- Open Questions section surfaced three genuine design decisions (optimistic vs confirmed removal, exhausted grid fallback, "already logged" scope) — all three were answered in the architecture spec, confirming they were the right questions.

## What Didn't Work

Nothing notable. The document was complete and unambiguous on first pass.

## Recommendations for Agent Improvement

None for this release. The delta-release framing (referencing prior versions as baseline) was appropriate and prevented scope inflation.
