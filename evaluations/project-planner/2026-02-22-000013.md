## What Was Asked

Produce `specs/plan-v1.2.md` with a parallelized task graph, per-task binary acceptance criteria, inline API contract for the new endpoint, and deliverables checklist with (NEW FILE) tags.

## What Worked

- **Parallelization structure correct on first pass:** Group 1 (schema + AugmentedMovie type, independent), Group 2 (migration, depends on schema), Group 3 (API route + page.tsx, parallel with each other, depend on schema), Group 4 (FeaturedMoviesGrid, depends on all of Group 3). Dependency ordering was exactly right.
- **Per-task binary acceptance criteria present on first pass** — a direct improvement from v1.0.0 where this was missing. All 6 tasks had checkboxes.
- **Inline API contract for Task 3.1** included method, auth, request shape, all response codes (201/200/400/401) — complete and accurate.
- **Deliverables checklist marked `(NEW FILE)` correctly** for `src/app/api/not-interested/route.ts`.
- **Task descriptions were specific enough for the dev agents** — no agent required clarification, and all 5 dev tasks passed on first attempt.
- **Architect APPROVED on first pass** with no REJECTED loop — the v1.1.0 refinements (mandatory criteria, API contracts, NEW FILE tags) paid off immediately.
- Correctly identified the `inArray` empty-array guard as a required implementation detail in Task 3.2.

## What Didn't Work

Nothing notable. First pass was approved with no revision required.

## Recommendations for Agent Improvement

The v1.1.0 improvements fully addressed the issues identified in the v1.0 evaluation. No further changes recommended at this time.
