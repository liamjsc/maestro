## What Was Asked

Produce a detailed implementation plan for Movie League v1.1 organized into parallelization groups, with acceptance criteria per task, agent assignments, and a deliverables checklist mapping every architecture artifact to exactly one task.

## What Worked

- Parallelization structure was correct on first pass: 14 independent Group 1 tasks, 2 Group 2 tasks (depending on LogEntryForm changes from Task 1.2), 2 Group 3 tasks (depending on Group 2 outputs)
- Dependency ordering was correct: LogEntryForm before LogMovieModal/FeaturedMoviesGrid; new components before Navbar/home page integration
- Task descriptions were specific and complete — agents needed no clarification to execute
- All 21 architecture deliverables were covered by exactly one task
- After the architect's revision request, the planner correctly addressed all 3 concerns: added binary acceptance criteria, documented the GET /api/watchlist contract inline, and marked new files explicitly in the checklist
- Revision was clean — task descriptions were preserved verbatim, only the missing elements were added

## What Didn't Work

- **First pass missing per-task acceptance criteria**: The initial plan had good task descriptions but lacked binary checkboxes on every task. The architect correctly REJECTED for this reason. The revision was quick and accurate, but the first pass should have included criteria by default given that the v1.0 `plan.md` demonstrated this pattern.
- **GET /api/watchlist contract not documented**: The plan added a new API endpoint without documenting its request/response contract, which the architect flagged as an architectural gap.
- **New files not explicitly marked**: `LogMovieModal.tsx` and `FeaturedMoviesGrid.tsx` were covered in task descriptions but absent from the deliverables checklist as distinct entries.

## Recommendations for Agent Improvement

- Always include per-task binary acceptance criteria — this is the primary mechanism by which the orchestrator validates outputs, and omitting them will always trigger a REJECTED review
- When a task introduces a new API endpoint (even in a route file that already exists), document the full contract (method, auth, request shape, response shape) inline in the task description
- For delta releases, explicitly mark new files (not just modified files) in the deliverables checklist with a "(NEW FILE)" tag
