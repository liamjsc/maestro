## What Was Asked
Produce a detailed implementation plan organized into parallelization groups, with clear acceptance criteria per task, agent assignments, and a deliverables checklist mapping every architecture artifact to exactly one task.

## What Worked
- Produced a complete 7-group, 13-task plan on the first pass; architect approved without revision
- Dependency ordering was correct: schema before utilities, utilities before API routes, API routes + components before pages
- Acceptance criteria were specific and binary — not vague ("compiles", "returns 401 without auth", "rating 3.3 returns 400") — making orchestrator validation straightforward
- Every architecture deliverable (51 files) was mapped to exactly one task in the checklist
- Correctly identified that all 6 Group 3 API route tasks were independent and could be parallelized
- Noted both eventType message variants for the Discord bot worker in Task 7.1 acceptance criteria, which was flagged as a gap by the architect in REVIEW mode (good catch)

## What Didn't Work
- Nothing failed. The plan was accepted and implementation proceeded without structural problems.

## Recommendations for Agent Improvement
- Consider flagging library version + API compatibility risks in task descriptions (e.g., "verify Drizzle version supports this syntax before proceeding") — this would have surfaced the v0.30 vs v0.32 schema syntax issue earlier
- Could suggest a final integration task (e.g., "run tsc --noEmit across all files") as an explicit task rather than leaving it to the orchestrator
