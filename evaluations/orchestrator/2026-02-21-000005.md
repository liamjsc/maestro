## What Was Asked
Coordinate the full software development pipeline for Movie League: gather requirements, delegate to requirements-analyst, systems-architect, project-planner, and dev agents in the correct order, validate outputs, manage retries, and write evaluations.

## What Worked
- The pipeline sequence (requirements → architecture → plan → architect review → implement → evaluate) executed correctly
- All 7 parallelization groups were dispatched correctly; Group 3 (6 API tasks) and Group 6 (5 page tasks) ran fully in parallel
- TypeScript compilation was run after Groups 1–4 and again after all Group 6 tasks, catching 4 errors and triggering a targeted fix
- Recovery from 4 rate-limited agents was handled efficiently: checked disk state, identified partial writes, dispatched only the missing files rather than full retries
- Plan architect review was clean (approved first pass); no plan revision loop needed

## What Didn't Work — CRITICAL: Insufficient Requirements Gathering

**The orchestrator moved to the requirements-analyst too quickly after the initial user prompt.**

The user's first message contained only a high-level sketch. The orchestrator asked 4 clarifying questions — tech stack, auth, Discord bot scope, and target directory — but critically missed several questions that would have been necessary to produce a complete, unambiguous spec:

1. **Groups were not mentioned in the first pass** — the user had to interrupt and provide the groups feature, group activity feeds, and the 5-star rating system as corrections *after* the requirements document was already being drafted. This wasted one full pipeline invocation.
2. **No questions about privacy model** (public vs private profiles/groups)
3. **No questions about follow symmetry** (one-directional vs mutual — deferred to architect, but a product decision the user could have answered)
4. **No questions about friend/social graph mechanics** (follow vs friend vs group-based feed)
5. **No questions about movie data source preferences** (TMDB vs OMDB — user had a preference right to defer but wasn't asked)
6. **No questions about notification specifics** (what events trigger Discord posts, message format preferences)
7. **No questions about desired UI aesthetic or branding** (dark mode? specific color scheme?)

The orchestrator should have spent more time in the GATHER REQUIREMENTS phase asking targeted product questions before proceeding. The user explicitly flagged this failure.

## Recommendations for Orchestrator Improvement
- In GATHER REQUIREMENTS, always ask about: (1) core entities and their relationships, (2) access control / privacy model, (3) social/network mechanics, (4) notification preferences, (5) UI/design preferences
- Use a structured requirements checklist before leaving Step 1 — do not proceed until all core feature areas are covered
- When a user's prompt mentions "friends" and "groups", explicitly confirm whether these are separate concepts and how they interact
- For social apps specifically: always ask about follow symmetry, public vs private visibility, and feed composition rules upfront
- Consider a "requirements completeness score" heuristic: if the prompt is under 200 words and describes a social app, ask at least 8 targeted product questions before proceeding
