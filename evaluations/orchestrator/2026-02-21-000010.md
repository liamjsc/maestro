## What Was Asked

Coordinate the v1.1 pipeline for Movie League after context was interrupted: resume from UX audit phase, delegate to requirements-analyst → systems-architect (DESIGN) → project-planner → systems-architect (REVIEW) → dev (16 parallel tasks), validate all outputs, run TypeScript check, and write evaluations.

## What Worked

- **Context recovery**: Successfully resumed from a prior session by reading the 5 existing evaluation files (which captured the full v1.0 state) and the partially-completed v1.1 spec files. No work was duplicated.
- **Pipeline execution**: All 6 steps executed in correct order with no skips or reordering
- **Architect review loop**: First pass REJECTED; planner revision addressed all 3 concerns; second pass APPROVED. Loop terminated at exactly 2 iterations.
- **Maximum parallelization**: All 14 Group 1 tasks dispatched as background agents in a single message sequence. Group 2 dispatched as soon as Task 1.2 completed (without waiting for all of Group 1). Group 3 dispatched immediately when both Group 2 tasks completed.
- **TypeScript check**: Clean on first pass — zero errors across all 21 modified/created files
- **All 16 dev tasks passed first attempt**: Zero retries needed
- **Evaluations written**: 5 evaluation files covering all pipeline agents

## What Didn't Work

- **Background task dispatch rate limiting**: Could only dispatch 1-2 background agents per message before the system prompted for another turn. The full 14-task Group 1 dispatch required ~7 sequential messages. This is a tool/rate constraint, not an orchestrator error, but it extended wall-clock time. In future, batching task descriptions into 2-3 per message (when permitted) would help.

## Recommendations for Orchestrator Improvement

- When dispatching large groups of background agents, monitor which agents have completed and immediately unblock dependent groups (as was done here for Group 2 after Task 1.2 completed) — don't wait for the entire prior group to finish if only one specific task is the dependency
- After a context interruption (session resumption), read evaluation files first — they are the most information-dense summary of prior pipeline state and enable accurate resumption without re-reading all spec files
